Note: Validation model code is taken from here: https://zenodo.org/record/3975545 or here:https://github.com/MicrosystemsLab/TFM-model/tree/master,
from this paper: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.14.250506. The archive contains some less effective routines,
but some of the code within this directory may be useful, in particular the 'planefit' routine.
Recommendation is to use either captured images, or synthetic images made with "Validation.py" script from all-in-one package folder,
and use the above MicrosystemsLab model to validate.
